The goal of this exercise is to suggest to Instacart customers items that they might want to purchase based on past orders. The dataset used was Instacart’s open sourced user’s transactional data - The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017. Also, a famous Kaggle competition of 2017. The dataset is a relational set of files describing customers’ orders over time. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.
